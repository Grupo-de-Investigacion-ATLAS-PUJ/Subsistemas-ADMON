             JCOP Framework Core


30 October 2023: fwCore-9.1.0
-------------------------------

Contained in the JCOP Framework 9.1.0 release.

* New component: fwStdLib regroups the recently implemented core functionality, notably enabling effective
    CTRL++ programming:
    - FwException class (previously in fwGeneral)
    - CtrlOOUtils (previously in fwCtrlUtils component)
    - CtrlJsonSerialization (previously in fwCtrlUtils)
* New component: fwStdUi providing utilities and building blocks for advanced user interfaces (panels):
    - new FwStdUi class with utility functions to pop up modernized dialog boxes for selection of item,
        text input or a message
    - new FwPanel class allowing to develope much cleaner code related to the use of reference panels, 
        and binding shapes to class/struct, effectively enabling Model-View programming. 
    - initial set of feature-rich Object-Oriented reference panels, working smoothly with CTRL++ lists
        and objects: selection list with filtering, powerful table with feature-rich headers, sorting/filtering
    - definition of modernized color style definitions, for the "light" and "dark" style; initial set of
        standardinzed icons (will be enhanced in the upcoming releases)
    - initial support for "variable UI density" (e.g. changing the text/icon sizes and spacing at runtime, e.g.
        for more ergonomic use at large/high-DPI screens); initial integration in the new Trending Tree.
* FwTree component with the alternative Object-Oriented API for tree structure management and a new
    refObject panel for visualization/operation, enabling drag-and-drop, etc; used e.g. in the new Trending Tool.
* fwConfigs: a set of new utility classes to handle the S7 configuration datapoints
* the AlertTone.wav file distributed with fwAlarmHandling component replaced with well known origin (sound-theme-freedesktop project);
    see data/licensing/fwAlarmHandling/CREDITS for details.
* Fix in CtrlOOUtils: fwIsInstanceOf() always returned false
* FWCORE-3153: fwAlerConfig_initialize(): if the object already initialized, clear it
* FWCORE-3386: Alarm Smoothing config panel: do not truncate the value by applying the formatting to text field

   Fix the panels popped up when NGA or RDB is used
